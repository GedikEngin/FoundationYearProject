      <h1>The Foundation Year</h1>
      <p>Many universities offer a foundation year course, but not many offer full access to campus
        facilities and treat you as if you were a traditional full-time student.
        This is where The University of Manchester distinguishes itself from the crowd.</p>
     <a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/2022/12952/bsc-computer-science-with-an-integrated-foundation-year/#course-profile" class="uni-webpage" target="_blank">More details on The Foundation Year</a>
    </div>
  </section>

  <div class="tab_title">What we have learnt</div>
  <div class="tab_content">This foundation year has taught us many key mathematical and computational
    skills in preperation for the full course. We have developed the ability to quickly pick up a new
    concept and apply it to various exam-style questions.</div>

  <div class="super_units">
    <div class="su1"><h2>Super Unit 1</h2>
      <p>OB1</p>
      <p>This unit focuses on basic higher-
        level mathematics such as 
        geometry, trigonometry, calculus 
        and series</p>
      <p>OB2</p>
      <p>This unit expands on 0B1 and 
        delves deeper into high level 
        mathematics. Complex numbers, 
        matrices and advanced calculus 
        are found here.</p>
      <p>OF2</p>
      <p>This unit focuses on vectors and 
        probability. You can expect to find 
        methods on how to find 
        intersections between planes and 
        lines and how to calculate various 
        distribution of random variables</p>
      <p>2 Alternate Units</p>
      <p>These replace 0B1 and 0B2, called 
        0C1 and 0C2 respectively. These 
        units are easier and less intense 
        than the B counterparts and are 
        intended to be used by students 
        who might not have had a 
        mathematical background. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="su2"><h2>Super Unit 2</h2>
      <p>There are 3 options to choose 
        from for 2 of the 3 units</p>
      <p>Optional units</p>
      <p>Physics 1</p>
      <p>This unit covers topics such as 
        pressure in fluids, 
        thermodynamics, kinetic theory 
        and deformation in matter. </p>
      <p>Physics 2</p>
      <p>This unit covers topics such as 
        magnetic fields, DC circuits and 
        electromagnetic induction</p>
      <p>Chemistry 1</p>
      <p>This unit covers topics such as Gas 
        laws, isotopes, equilibrium and 
        phase diagrams. </p>
      <p>Mandatory unit</p>
      <p>Computational Thinking</p>
      <p>This unit is designed to develop 
        a student’s analytical abilities 
        and to teach them the basics of 
        interpreting a program written 
        in pseudocode</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="su3"><h2>Super Unit 3</h2>
      <p>ON1</p>
      <p>This unit overviews how to use 
        and interpret sets, subsets and set 
        notation. This unit also covers 
        proof of inequalities, linear and 
        quadratic inequalities </p>
      <p>OJ2</p>
      <p>This unit covers mechanics in 1D, 
        2D and 3D. You can expect to see 
        Newtons laws, the use of SUVAT 
        equations, projectiles, moments, 
        laws of friction and centre of mass.</p>
      <p>OD2</p>
      <p>This unit covers numerical 
        interpolation and calculus. It also 
        covers polar coordinates, areas, 
        lengths and volumes inside polar 
        curves. This unit also teaches the 
        student how to use a program 
        called Mathematica which is 
        operated much like how one 
        would program code.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="su4"><h2>Super Unit 4</h2>
      <p>ICT</p>
      <p>This unit was deigned to teach 
        students how to make use of 
        Blackboard, how to use excel for 
        graph plotting and making 
        spreadsheets and how to use tools 
        to aid in referencing academic 
        papers correctly</p>
      <p>Academic Skills</p>
      <p>This unit aims to teach students 
        how to produce an academic piece 
        of writing, how to present ideas 
        logically and how to deliver 
        academic oral presentations.</p>
      <p>Foundation Year Project</p>
      <p>This unit combines the knowledge 
        gained in the first two units. You 
        must work in groups to produce an 
        academic report and present your 
        work after you’ve completed the 
        project. </p>
